# Banking_Customer_Churn
This is a personal project to enhance my technical skills in data analysis, and also to sharpen my business acumen in financial sector. This porject was conducted individually, from data cleaning and dashboard building. 

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a retail banking institution using Excel. The aim is to identify key factors that contribute to churn, understand customer behavior, and provide actionable insights for retention strategies through data visualization and descriptive statistics.

## Objectives

1. Identify patterns and trends among churned vs retained customers

2. Analyze demographic and behavioral factors influencing churn

3. Create an interactive dashboard for country-level comparisons

4. Recommend data-driven strategies to reduce churn

## Tools used

### Microsoft Excel

1. Pivot Tables

2. XLOOKUP & INDEX-MATCH

3. Conditional Formatting

4. Charts & Slicers

## Key Insights & Recommendations
### 1. Churn rate by Salary range and Account Balance
* Across all salary ranges, high balance customers consistently show higher churn rates than those with normal balances.
* The highest churn (25.6%) occurs among high balance customers earning $51K‚Äì$100K, a financially literate group likely to compare banks for better services and returns.
* This poses a risk to the bank‚Äôs revenue and customer base, as high balance customers are typically more profitable and present opportunities for premium and personalized offerings. Losing them represents a significant revenue loss.
#### Country-level Insight: Spain
* Among surveyed countries, female customers in Spain show the highest churn rate within this segment, at 32%.
* Potential factors include cultural mismatches, strong local competition, and high financial literacy, making these customers more selective and value-driven.
#### Recommendations
* Conduct targeted research and engagement with female customers in Spain.
* Revamp customer experience, loyalty rewards, and financial tools tailored to this group.
* Implement exit surveys to uncover key drivers behind churn.
### 2. Churn rate by Product Holding
* Customers holding 2 products recorded the lowest churn rate, while those with 4 products showed the highest.
* Holding 4 products may create complexity or dissatisfaction if not integrated effectively.
* Higher service fees, lack of personalization, and unmet expectations (e.g., no added rewards despite multiple products) may contribute to dissatisfaction.
* In contrast, 2-product customers likely made intentional choices, leading to stronger engagement without the burden of complexity.
* This ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù offers enough value to encourage loyalty without overwhelming the customer.
* Consistent patterns observed across all countries surveyed; no major country-specific deviations.
#### Recommendations
* Evaluate customers‚Äô financial health and satisfaction, factoring in income, obligations, and feedback.
* Review product bundling and sales practices to ensure customers adopt products intentionally, not under pressure.
* Assess product quality and integration, focusing on how well they improve customer convenience and experience.
### 3. Churn rate by tenure and salary range
* Overall, customers with longer tenure at the bank tend to show the highest churn rates across most salary ranges ‚Äî except for those earning between 151K and 200K.
* This trend may reflect dissatisfaction with the bank‚Äôs loyalty programs. Long-term customers might feel that their loyalty is not being rewarded adequately and seek better benefits elsewhere.
* Interestingly, within the 151K‚Äì200K salary group, the highest churn rate is observed among customers who have been with the bank for only 0‚Äì4 years.
* This group likely consists of financially savvy individuals with high expectations. They may quickly identify a lack of value and choose to leave the bank early if their expectations are unmet.
#### Recommendations
* Enhance loyalty programmes for long-term customers, such as tiered loyalty program according to their tenure such as fee waivers for services for customers that are 5 years old in the bank, to ensure the customers feel appreciated and the services are worth the loyalty.
* Revamp onboarding for high-income customers by creating a premium onboarding experience with concierge-like support, hence creating a lasting first-impression to these segment of customers.
* Monitor and benchmark competitors rate and services.
### 4. Anomaly in churn rate by credit score
* Customers without credit card yet with a high credit score recorded the highest churn rate.
* This segment of customer are credit-worthy and likely be financially responsible, making them attractive to other banks.
* It is possible that the current credit card services provided by the bank are not appealing to this segment, and prefers other banks with credit card services more tailored to their needs and credit-worthiness such as higher cashback and travel rewards.
* Even if good packages exists, salesperson may not be communicating clearly on the perks and benefits of the package to this segment, making poor marketing and communication a possible explanation for this anomaly.
#### Recommendations
* Always gather for customer feedback either when they are still subscribed to the service, or exit survey when they choose to opt out from the service.
* Improve communication and marketing skills among salesperson to ensure the information for credit card services are aptly delivered.
* Introduce tiered-based cards to offer rewards and exclusive privileges for customers according to their spending levels and creditworthiness.


## Future Improvements
To enhance the depth and scalability of this project:
* Integrate Power BI for richer storytelling and interactive dashboards.
* Use Python and machine learning models to predict churn rates based on current trends.
* Employ SQL with advanced queries (e.g., window functions, subqueries, and CTEs) for deeper analysis.
* Include customer feedback and add date-based fields (e.g., subscription and churn dates) for improved insight and churn lifecycle modeling.

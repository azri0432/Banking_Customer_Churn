# Banking_Customer_Churn

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a retail banking institution using Excel. The aim is to identify key factors that contribute to churn, understand customer behavior, and provide actionable insights for retention strategies through data visualization and descriptive statistics.

## Objectives

1. Identify patterns and trends among churned vs retained customers

2. Analyze demographic and behavioral factors influencing churn

3. Create an interactive dashboard for country-level comparisons

4. Recommend data-driven strategies to reduce churn

## Tools used

### Microsoft Excel

1. Pivot Tables

2. XLOOKUP & INDEX-MATCH

3. Conditional Formatting

4. Charts & Slicers

## Key Insights & Recommendations
### 1. Churn rate by Salary range and Account Balance
* Across all salary ranges, high balance customers consistently show higher churn rates than those with normal balances.
* The highest churn (25.6%) occurs among high balance customers earning $51K‚Äì$100K, a financially literate group likely to compare banks for better services and returns.
* This is concerning, as high balance customers are typically more profitable and present opportunities for premium and personalized offerings. Losing them represents a significant revenue loss.
#### Country-level Insight: Spain
* Among surveyed countries, female customers in Spain show the highest churn rate within this segment, at 32%.
* Potential factors include cultural mismatches, strong local competition, and high financial literacy, making these customers more selective and value-driven.
#### Recommendations
* Conduct targeted research and engagement with female customers in Spain.
* Revamp customer experience, loyalty rewards, and financial tools tailored to this group.
* Implement exit surveys to uncover key drivers behind churn.
### 2. Churn rate by Product Holding
* Customers holding 2 products recorded the lowest churn rate, while those with 4 products showed the highest.
* Holding 4 products may feel overwhelming, especially if the products are poorly integrated or not aligned with customer needs.
* Higher service fees, lack of personalization, and unmet expectations (e.g., no added rewards despite multiple products) may contribute to dissatisfaction.
* In contrast, 2-product customers likely made intentional choices, leading to stronger engagement without the burden of complexity.
* This ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù offers enough value to encourage loyalty without overwhelming the customer.
* Consistent patterns observed across all countries surveyed; no major country-specific deviations.
#### Recommendations
* Evaluate customers‚Äô financial health and satisfaction, factoring in income, obligations, and feedback.
* Review product bundling and sales practices to ensure customers adopt products intentionally, not under pressure.
* Assess product quality and integration, focusing on how well they improve customer convenience and experience.
### 3. Churn rate by age and salary range


## Future Improvements
To further generate meaningful insights from this project, I will incorporate Power BI and also Python to integrate machine learning to forecast the churn rate in the future based on current trend. Power BI will be used to enhance data storytelling and visualize data more efficiently. SQL could be used especially with window functions, subqueries and CTEs for a deeper analysis. I will also include customer feedback data and an improved dataset with important dates to accurately derive deeper insights from this project.

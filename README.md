## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a retail banking institution using Excel. The aim is to identify key factors that contribute to churn, understand customer behavior, and provide actionable insights for retention strategies through data visualization and descriptive statistics.

## Objectives

1. Identify patterns and trends among churned vs retained customers

2. Analyze demographic and behavioral factors influencing churn

3. Create an interactive dashboard for country-level comparisons

4. Recommend data-driven strategies to reduce churn

## Tools used

### Microsoft Excel

1. Pivot Tables

2. XLOOKUP & INDEX-MATCH

3. Conditional Formatting

4. Charts & Slicers

## Key Insights & Suggestions

## Future Improvements
To further generate meaningful insights from this project, I will incorporate Power BI and also Python to integrate machine learning to forecast the churn rate in the future based on current trend. Power BI will be used to enhance data storytelling and visualize data more efficiently. SQL could be used especially with window functions, subqueries and CTEs for a deeper analysis. I will also include customer feedback data and an improved dataset with important dates to accurately derive deeper insights from this project.
